# Craft CMS

[Craft] Content Management System.

This setup uses the official Docker images and is close to the standard Docker Compose setup.
The Riptide app comes with a mail catcher.

The default setup assumes one volume for assets at web/uploads.

In order to use Redis (which comes by default with this), make sure your app
is configured to use Redis as explained in the [documentation] and uses the
environment variable REDIS_HOST for the hostname.

In order to use Varnish, install the plugin Upper with default configuration.


## `/app/craft/base`

Craft CMS base variant.

### Services

#### cvarnish

that image contains the XKey plugin.

| vcl | /etc/varnish/default.vcl | maybe               | A VCL that works with Upper |

#### cwww

**Based on**: [/service/php/7.4/fpm](https://github.com/Parakoopa/riptide-repo/tree/master/service/php)
**Image:** `craftcms/nginx:7.4-dev`

PHP Version 7.2 with the Nginx webserver; image is the official Craft CMS image.

##### Roles

**Has roles**: `src`, `php`, `varnish`

Has access to source code (`src`) and is marked as main PHP service (`php`).
It is the backend for Varnish (`varnish`).

Environment variables starting with `CEXTRA_` passed to this service will be added to the very
end of the generated .env file.

##### Config

Riptide manages the .env file used with Craft CMS directly. Some values in that file get dynamically generated.
The environment file is loaded by Craft automatically and should be used in the configuration PHP files.
The advantage of directly working with this file, is that it is also read by CLI out of the box.

You can extend the Craft CMS Nginx server configuration by adding additional config files at `/etc/nginx/craftcms/x-*.conf`.
